# SecureScuttlebutt: A Secure Gossip Protocol

(talk given at New Zealand Internet Research Forum)

I have a terrible(/great?) habit of writing my slides in markdown (easiest)
and then quickly writing an html slide viewer in 20 minutes
before my presentation.
This time, I used electron so that I did not have to
preconvert my slides into html. Maybe I do that a little
different next time. Of course, once I have given my presentation,
I consistently neglect to actually publish my slide viewer so I
just end up writing another one next time.

To run, clone this repo and then do `npm install; npm start`
